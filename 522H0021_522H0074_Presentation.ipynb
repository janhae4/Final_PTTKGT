        "## **Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "The discovery of valuable patterns in large datasets is a critical area of research in data mining. Among various techniques, **High-Utility Itemset Mining (HUIM)** has emerged as a powerful approach for identifying itemsets that yield the most significant utilities, such as profit or impact. However, real-world datasets often exhibit complexity due to **unstable databases** (dynamic updates or changes) and the presence of **both positive and negative utilities** (profits and losses). These challenges necessitate the development of advanced algorithms to efficiently mine **Top-K High-Utility Itemsets (THUIs)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "This research focuses on the **design and analysis of algorithms** that can handle these challenges while ensuring scalability and efficiency. The input data consists of transactional datasets with utilities represented as quantities and profits. The output is a list of Top-K itemsets ranked by their utility scores. Below, we explore the critical terms, the structure of the input data, and the expected output.\n",

        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The **EMHUN** (Efficient High-Utility Itemset Mining with Negative Utility) algorithm is designed to efficiently discover high-utility itemsets from a transaction database that includes both positive and negative utility values for the items. The algorithm utilizes a recursive search strategy and partitioning of items into disjoint sets to identify high-utility itemsets while minimizing the search space.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Steps of the Algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Partitioning Items into Sets:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **rho (Positive items):** Items that have only positive profits across all transactions.\n",
        "   - **delta (Hybrid items):** Items that have both positive and negative profits.\n",
        "   - **eta (Negative items):** Items that have only negative profits across all transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Utility Calculation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Each item’s total utility is computed and stored in the `rtwu_dict` dictionary. Utility is determined by multiplying the item's profit by the quantity for each transaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Sorting and Filtering:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Items are sorted based on their utility values (`rtwu_dict`), considering their categorization into **rho**, **delta**, and **eta**.\n",
        "   - The `secondary_items` are selected based on whether they belong to **rho** or **delta**, while the `eta_sorted` contains items from the **eta** set, sorted by utility.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Recursive Search:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The `searchN` function is used to recursively explore combinations of items from the **eta** set and their utilities. This helps refine the search and prune unpromising itemsets early based on the remaining utility of negative items.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Result Collection:**\n",
        "   - The final result consists of high-utility itemsets that meet the minimum utility threshold (`minU`) and are ordered by their utility. The algorithm terminates when the top **K** high-utility itemsets are found.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm returns the top **K** itemsets along with their utilities, sorted in descending order of utility.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Efficient Partitioning:** By dividing items into **rho**, **delta**, and **eta**, the algorithm reduces the complexity of the search space and focuses on promising itemsets.\n",
        "- **Recursive Search:** The recursive nature of the algorithm allows it to explore item combinations efficiently while pruning non-promising paths early on.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach is particularly effective for databases where both positive and negative utilities are present, allowing for a more nuanced exploration of itemsets compared to traditional high-utility itemset mining algorithms.\n"

        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The **EHMIN** (Efficient High-Utility Mining with Negative Utility) algorithm is designed to mine high-utility itemsets from a transactional database where items can have both positive and negative utilities. It uses a prefix tree-based approach and dynamic utility lists to identify high-utility itemsets efficiently while minimizing the search space and avoiding the exploration of non-promising itemsets.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Steps of the Algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **First Scan (Classification of Items):**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The database is scanned to classify items into three categories:\n",
        "     - **Positive items:** Items with only positive utilities across all transactions.\n",
        "     - **Hybrid items:** Items that have both positive and negative utilities.\n",
        "     - **Negative items:** Items with only negative utilities.\n",
        "   - The total utility and remaining total utility (RTWU) are calculated for each item during this scan.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Utility List and EUCS Cache Construction:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - A Utility List (UL) dictionary is created to store the utility and PRU (Potential Remaining Utility) of each item, along with the list of transactions where the item appears.\n",
        "   - An EUCS (Efficient Utility Co-occurrence Support) matrix is created to store the co-occurrence utility for pairs of items, which helps in efficiently pruning the search space during subsequent scans.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Second Scan (Creation of Utility List and EUCS Matrix):**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The second scan calculates the utility list (UL) and the EUCS matrix for pairs of items. The EUCS matrix is used to efficiently calculate the combined utility of item pairs during the mining process.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Prefix Tree Construction:**\n",
        "   - The algorithm constructs a prefix tree, starting from the root (empty itemset), and recursively explores itemsets by extending the prefix with new items.\n",
        "   - During each extension, the algorithm checks if the utility of the itemset exceeds the minimum utility threshold (`min_util`).\n",
        "5. **Utility List Combination (EHMIN_Combine):**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The algorithm combines utility lists from two itemsets if the combined utility exceeds the minimum utility threshold. This involves merging transaction utilities and adjusting the remaining utilities based on the prefix utilities of transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Recursive Mining (EHMIN_Mine):**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The recursive mining function explores the prefix tree to find high-utility itemsets. It prunes the search space based on the combined utility and the co-occurrence utility (from the EUCS matrix), only exploring itemsets that meet the minimum utility threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Result Collection:**\n",
        "   - The final result consists of high-utility itemsets that meet the minimum utility threshold (`min_util`), ordered by their utility values in descending order.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm returns the top **K** high-utility itemsets along with their utilities, sorted in descending order of utility.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Efficient Pruning:** The use of utility lists and the EUCS matrix significantly reduces the search space by pruning non-promising itemsets early in the process.\n",
        "- **Prefix Tree Exploration:** The recursive prefix tree-based approach allows the algorithm to dynamically build itemsets and explore them efficiently.\n",
        "- **Handling Negative Utility:** The algorithm effectively handles negative utility items, which is crucial for databases where both positive and negative utility values are present.\n",
        "\n",
        "This algorithm is particularly useful for databases containing both positive and negative utility values, providing an efficient way to mine high-utility itemsets while avoiding the combinatorial explosion typical of traditional itemset mining methods.\n"

        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The **TOPIC** (Top-K Utility Itemset Combination) algorithm is designed to efficiently mine top-K high-utility itemsets from a transactional database. It focuses on identifying itemsets that meet a minimum utility threshold and incorporates a combination of positive, hybrid, and negative utility items. The algorithm uses a recursive approach to explore potential itemsets and refine the search space based on remaining utility, utilizing utility lists, recursive searches, and filtering techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Steps of the Algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **First Scan (Item Classification and Utility Calculation):**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The first scan of the database classifies items into three categories:\n",
        "     - **Positive items:** Items with positive utilities across all transactions.\n",
        "     - **Hybrid items:** Items with both positive and negative utilities.\n",
        "     - **Negative items:** Items with only negative utilities.\n",
        "   - Additionally, the remaining total utility (RTWU) of each item is computed during this scan.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Utility List and Remaining Utility Calculation (RIU):**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The algorithm constructs a list of itemsets with their utilities. For each item, the algorithm calculates the utility (`u`) of the itemsets, which is used for determining if an itemset meets the minimum utility threshold.\n",
        "   - The utility list (`RIU_list`) is sorted, and the **k-th highest utility** is retrieved using the `RIU` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Database Filtering (Remove Empty and Out-of-Scope Items):**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The database is filtered to remove transactions that contain no items, and items that are not part of the top-K itemsets are removed using the `remove_items_outside_items_database` and `remove_empty_items_database` functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Transaction Sorting:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - After filtering, the transactions are sorted based on the relevant items to optimize the mining process.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Recursive Search (Search_P and Search_N):**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The algorithm performs recursive searches using the `search_P` and `search_N` functions. These functions explore different combinations of primary and secondary items to identify high-utility itemsets.\n",
        "   - The `search_N` function handles the exploration of negative utility items, while `search_P` focuses on expanding itemsets using both primary and secondary items.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Primary and Secondary Item Expansion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - In each recursive search, the algorithm expands the current itemset by adding primary items and further explores secondary items with remaining utility (using Remaining Support Utility and Remaining Local Utility values) to refine the search.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Result Collection (Top-K Itemsets):**\n",
        "   - The algorithm collects high-utility itemsets that meet the minimum utility threshold and orders them by utility. The top-K itemsets are then returned as the final output.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm returns the top **K** high-utility itemsets along with their utilities, sorted in descending order of utility.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Efficient Pruning:** By combining utility lists and filtering out non-promising itemsets, the algorithm significantly reduces the search space, leading to efficient mining.\n",
        "- **Recursive Exploration:** The recursive approach helps explore and expand itemsets dynamically, considering both primary and secondary items for high-utility combinations.\n",
        "- **Handling Negative Utility:** The algorithm effectively handles negative utility items, which is crucial for databases where both positive and negative utility values are present.\n",
        "- **Top-K Selection:** The algorithm ensures that only the top-K itemsets with the highest utility values are returned, optimizing the process for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "This algorithm is particularly useful for mining high-utility itemsets in databases containing both positive and negative utilities, offering a scalable and efficient solution for the discovery of significant itemsets in transactional data.\n"
